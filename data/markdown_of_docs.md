# Getting Started with Neo4py

## Introduction
**neo4py** is a better alternative to **py2neo**. Though still in **beta phase**, you can use it in your projects.

## Setting up Neo4py
I recommend creating a **venv** first using **uv** to start any of your Python project.

Follow these steps:

1. In your terminal run:
```
pip install uv
```

2. To create a **venv** run:
```
uv venv
```
This command will create a **venv**.

3. Now to **activate** the venv:

In **Windows** run:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

In case of **Linux** run:
```
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install the **neo4j** using this command:
```
uv pip install neo4j
```

5. Install the **neo4py** using this command:
```
uv pip install neo4py
```

## Example Code
Let me show you how to use **neo4py** with a simple example.

Import the **neo4py** using this command:
```python
from neo4py.neo4py import Graph
```

Now create a **Graph** object, and pass the connection details to the **Graph** class:
```python
graph = Graph("connection_uri", ("user", "db_password"))
```

Or:
```python
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", ("neo4j", "12345678"))
```

You can find your **connection uri** and **user** details when you start your database and open the neo4j browser. Password is the **password** that you have set while creating the database.

Give your data to the **run** method in this way:
```python
data = {'name': 'Athar Naveed', 'age': 21}
```

```python
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", ("neo4j", "12345678"))
```

Now to run the **cypher query**, go with:
```python
graph.run(query, **data)
```

## Utilizing Sloth Class
The Sloth class is for the **Sloths** (like me ðŸ˜€). Let me show you how to use **Sloth** with a simple example.

Import the **sloth** using this command:
```python
from neo4py.sloth import Sloth
```

Now create a **Sloth** object, and pass the connection details to the **Sloth** class:
```python
sloth = Sloth("connection_uri", ("user", "db_password"))
```

Or:
```python
sloth = Sloth("bolt://localhost:7687", ("neo4j", "12345678"))
```

You can find your **connection uri** and **user** details when you start your database and open the neo4j browser. Password is the **password** that you have set while creating the database.

Currently **Sloth** has only **2 methods**:
1. create_node
2. read_node

### Creating Nodes
You just have to pass your data in a **dict** format of Python, and it'll create the **nodes** and **labels** with respect to it.

To create **nodes** you have to use this command:
```python
sloth.create_node([
    {
        'name': 'Athar',
        'age': 20,
        'gender': 'male',
        'labels': 'Single Label',
    },
    {
        'name': 'Naveed',
        'age': 50,
        'gender': 'male',
        'labels': ['Single Label', 'List of Labels']
    },
])
```

The create_node method takes a **list of dictionaries** and creates nodes based on the provided data. The labels attribute/key can take **one** to a **list of labels**.

### Reading Nodes
Currently you can only retrieve **all records**. Each record will include its **id**.

To read **all nodes** you have to use this command:
```python
sloth.read_node('*')
```

This method will return all of the records as a **list of dictionaries** you can iterate over the records to retrieve them. **Like this**:

```python
# code
records = sloth.read_node('*')
for record in records:
    print(f'user id: {record["id"]}')
    print(f'user name: {record["name"]}')
    print(f'user age: {record["age"]}')
    print(f'user labels: {record["label"]}')
    print('=====================================')

# output
user id: 0
user name: Athar
user age: 22
user labels: Human
=====================================
user id: 1
user name: Naveed
user age: 52
user labels: ['Person', 'Human']
=====================================
```
